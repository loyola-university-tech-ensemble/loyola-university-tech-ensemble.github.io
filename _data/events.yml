    LUTE's semi-annual informal reading of Terry Riley’s “In C” arranged for
    laptop ensemble is happening on December 12th, 2018. Come take a stress break
    from final exams to commune with Terry Riley’s 1964 minimalist masterwork
    via laptop. We are seeking thoughtful individuals from all backgrounds and
    technical and/or musical abilities. This all-laptop version of “In C” is
    designed to be inclusive for musicians, “non” musicians, and anyone who
    wants to experience playing in an ensemble in a whole new way. The emphasis
    is on listening, responding, and collaborating to make music. Let the
    machines handle playing all the notes for once!

    If you are planning attending, please bring a laptop running either macOS
    or Windows. We are looking for audience participation! If you can, please
    come when the doors open at 9am so we can help you set up your computer.
    This reading is informal, so come and go as you please!
